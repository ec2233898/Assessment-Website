            <h2>WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON FORESTS?</h2>
            <h3>In our largest rainforest, The Amazon, when forest is lost a vicious cycle becomes established. The more forest that is lost, the less rainfall is produced by the forest and drought and fire effects cause even more forest losses. This loop could cause the entire Amazon forest biome to reach a tipping point where it's lost to a state of permanent degradation.<br>
            <br>  On top of that, many surviving forests have been so damaged and degraded that the plants and animals that rely on them are threatened with extinction. Over time these remaining forests are being emptied of the wildlife that once called them home.</h3>

          <h2>WHY ARE FORESTS SO IMPORTANT?</h2>
          <h3> * Forests aren’t just full of trees – they're teeming with all kinds of life. In fact, they’re home to an enormous 80% of the world’s land-based animals, insects and plant species, and around 300 million people. <br>
        * Yet no matter where you live, forests are crucial to every one of us. They recycle the air we breathe, and regulate rainfall and climate patterns around the world. Their ecosystem services even include water purification and carbon sequestration.<br>
         All of this makes forests our greatest asset in the fight against climate change. You could say forests are the life support system for our world. </h3>
